In this work, we have performed an experimental study of exact and approximate solution methods on the traveling salesman problem. In particular, we presented algorithms based on each optimization method. Comparative experiments between these algorithms have been carried out
have been performed on tests of various sizes. The results showed the following.
● Exact methods provide the exact solution, but at a high time
● The heuristics and metaheuristics give a very short time, but not the exact solution, and also depends on the initialization parameters .
