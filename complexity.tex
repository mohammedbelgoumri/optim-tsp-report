\section{Computational Complexity}

    Throughout this document, we will often find ourselevs in need of a method to objectively measure the difficulty of a problem or the efficiency of an algorithm. Fortunately, there exists an entire branch of theoretical computer science that addresses these very questions: \emph{the theory of computational complexity}.

    The theory of computational complexity formalizes the intuitive concept of the \emph{difficulty} of a problem. Quite reasonably, this discipline relies on the premise that a problem is as difficult as it is to perform its most efficient solution, or, to use technical terms, to \emph{execute the most efficient algorithm} that solves the problem.
