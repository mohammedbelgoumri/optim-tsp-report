\chapter{Approximate Solutions 1 (Heuristics)}

Despite them being exact, the algorithms we introduced so far are not always practical to use on a real world problem. This is due to their computational expense. No efficient exact algorithm known for the \TSP. In fact, under the assumption \(\classP\neq\classNP\), no such algorithm exists. A reasonable alternative to consider is finding an efficient \emph{approximate} algorithm.

Approximate methods sacrifice the exactness of the solution for efficiency. The extent to which we can tolerate loss of accuracy is however limited. A constant time solution is useless if it gives a sufficiently large error.
