\chapter{Branch and Bound}

\section{Motivation}

    The direct method as we have seen is, despite the simplicity of its implementation, unrealistically slow for even very small instances. 
    
    Faster exact algorithms exist, but none of them is polynomial since TSP is NP-complete. In fact, under the assumption \(P\neq NP\), no polynomial solution exists.

    Branch and Bound is one such algorithm that we will dedicate the rest of the chapter to.

\section{The idea of Branch and Bound}

    The idea of Branch and Bound is to eliminate certain branches from the search space to decrease runtime.

    This is done by computing a \emph{lower bound} and \emph{upper bound} for every branch, and then pruning branches that are garanted to be worse than the best known solution.
