\subsection{Optimization Problems and Their Classification}

Despite their ubiquity, decison problems are not always powerful enough to model a given situation. Combinatorial optimization extends them with a much more general class of problems. Instead of finding a binary answer, a combinatorial optimization problem (or simply, an optimization problem) seeks an \emph{optimal} solution in a discrete \emph{space of options}.
